# country-data-assignment

1. Fetch 10 countries from http://countrylayer.com/
2. We should be able to transform the data in different formats like json, xml and csv. There should be a common interface for it, so that in future more formats can be added.
3. Create a render routine where we can render country's data in different fasion like list, grid and circle. This should also be extendable in future.
 
Time: 8 - 10 hours
